## Project Structure

- `todo_backend/` - This directory contains the Ruby on Rails API that handles data management for the todo items.
- `todo_frontend/` - This directory contains the React application which communicates with the Rails API to display and manage the todo items.

## Technologies Used

- **Ruby on Rails** for building the backend REST API.
- **React** for building the interactive frontend.
- **PostgreSQL** for database management.
- **Axios** for handling HTTP requests from the React frontend to the Rails backend.
- **Tailwind CSS** (or Bootstrap, based on your choice) for styling the application.
