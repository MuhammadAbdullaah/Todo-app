# Todo App - Rails + React

This project is a **Todo List** application built with **Ruby on Rails** for the backend and **React** for the frontend. The purpose of this project is to practice integrating a Rails API with a React frontend.

## Features

- **Backend (Ruby on Rails)**:
  - RESTful API to handle CRUD operations for Todo items.
  - Database management with PostgreSQL.
  - Basic validation and error handling for Todo creation and updates.
  
- **Frontend (React)**:
  - Display Todos with options to mark as completed or delete.
  - Interactive UI with checkboxes to toggle completion status.
  - Real-time updates using React hooks and Axios for API communication.


## Project Structure

- `todo_backend/` - This directory contains the Ruby on Rails API that handles data management for the todo items.
- `todo_frontend/` - This directory contains the React application which communicates with the Rails API to display and manage the todo items.

## Technologies Used

- **Ruby on Rails** for building the backend REST API.
- **React** for building the interactive frontend.
- **PostgreSQL** for database management.
- **Axios** for handling HTTP requests from the React frontend to the Rails backend.
- **Tailwind CSS** (or Bootstrap, based on your choice) for styling the application.
